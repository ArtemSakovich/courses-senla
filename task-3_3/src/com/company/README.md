The task of the assembly line is to assemble complex products, consisting of 3 components. To set up each part, a specialized class (which implements ILineStep) is used that supplies the required part via the buildProductPart () method. To assemble a product, its blank is passed to the assembleProduct () method. Within the method, the line receives the 3 required constituents and "sets" them into the corresponding methods of the resulting product. After completing the "assembly", the finished product is returned from the assembleProduct () method.
